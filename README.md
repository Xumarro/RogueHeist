## üß† Game Design

### 1. **Player Intent**
Rogue Heist encourages the player to experiment with different strategies ‚Äî stealth, combat, or a mix of both. Every decision impacts the flow of the game, with a dynamic AI system that reacts to your actions.

### 2. **Core Mechanics**
- **Stealth Kills**: You can silently take down guards from behind (press [E] when close). Press [Q} to hide the body, but be aware, hiding does take time, so take down enemies strategically.
- **Alert System**: If a guard sees you or finds a body, an alert phase begins.
- **Lockdown Mechanic**: If bodies are found, the facility enters **lockdown**. You must escape or survive reinforcements.
- **Health and Healing**: Use limited resources to heal or hide when injured. (More items can be purchased at the end of each failed attempt) ((Loot successfully stolen can be used to purchase items, or gadgets))

### 3. **Lockdown Feature**
- If a body is discovered, the alarm triggers and the facility enters **lockdown**.
- **Reinforcements** arrive, and you have limited time to fight or escape.
- The **exit is locked** until you disable the lockdown, successfully escape through hidden routes or survive the onslaught of guards.
- Players can **fight** through waves of guards or **escape** through hidden routes or by unlocking the exit.

### 4. **Character Selection**
- **Layla**: A brainiac who excels in hacking, mechanics, and problem-solving. Her perk allows her to interact with devices, hack doors, or disable security with ease.
- **Lewis**: A more athletic and stealthy character. His perk grants faster movement, climbing abilities, and more effective sneaking past guards without being detected or steathily taking down a guard for their key cards for locked loot chests.

### 5. **Failure States**
- If you‚Äôre killed, the run ends and you restart from the beginning.
- If the alarm reaches the highest level, the facility will lock down, and you must either escape or defeat all enemies to continue.
