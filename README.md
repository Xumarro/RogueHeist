# Rogue Heist: Name Pending

A dynamic and challenging roguelike game where you play as a robber trying to infiltrate high-security locations to make your escape. Use stealth, combat, and strategy to outsmart or defeat guards, but be careful ‚Äî every decision has consequences. If you‚Äôre spotted, the whole place goes into lockdown, and you‚Äôll have to fight your way out!

## üöÄ Features

- **Choose Your Character**: Select between two unique characters, each with their own playstyle.
  - **Layla**: A highly intelligent female robber who specializes in mechanics and hacking, offering a more brainiac approach.
  - **Lewis**: A stealthy, ninja-like male robber with enhanced athleticism and skills for evasion and sneaking.
- **Stealth Kills**: Take out guards silently to avoid triggering alarms.
- **Combat Mode**: If you're spotted, you can fight your way out, but guards will shoot back.
- **Lockdown**: If a guard finds a body, the entire facility goes into lockdown. Reinforcements spawn, and you must fight your way to escape.
- **Health System**: Heal or hide to recover from injuries.
- **AI Behavior**: Guard AI responds dynamically to player actions (searching for bodies, calling for reinforcements, etc.).
- **Multiple Playstyles**: You can choose between stealth, panther (tactical kills), or full combat.

## üß† Game Design

### 1. **Player Intent**
Rogue Heist encourages the player to experiment with different strategies ‚Äî stealth, combat, or a mix of both. Every decision impacts the flow of the game, with a dynamic AI system that reacts to your actions.

### 2. **Core Mechanics**
- **Stealth Kills**: You can silently take down guards from behind (press [E] when close).
- **Alert System**: If a guard sees you or finds a body, an alert phase begins.
- **Lockdown Mechanic**: If bodies are found, the facility enters **lockdown**. You must escape or survive reinforcements.
- **Health and Healing**: Use limited resources to heal or hide when injured.

### 3. **Lockdown Feature**
- If a body is discovered, the alarm triggers and the facility enters **lockdown**.
- **Reinforcements** arrive, and you have limited time to fight or escape.
- The **exit is locked** until you disable the lockdown or survive the onslaught of guards.
- Players can **fight** through waves of guards or **escape** through hidden routes or by unlocking the exit.

### 4. **Character Selection**
- **Layla**: A brainiac who excels in hacking, mechanics, and problem-solving. Her perk allows her to interact with devices, hack doors, or disable security with ease.
- **Lewis**: A more athletic and stealthy character. His perk grants faster movement, climbing abilities, and more effective sneaking past guards without being detected.

### 5. **Failure States**
- If you‚Äôre killed, the run ends and you restart from the beginning.
- If the alarm reaches the highest level, the facility will lock down, and you must either escape or defeat all enemies to continue.

## üéÆ Gameplay Walkthrough

1. **Start Infiltration**: Begin the heist by sneaking through high-security rooms, avoiding guards, and collecting loot.
2. **Get Spotted**: If spotted by a guard, you can choose to fight or retreat. 
3. **Lockdown Triggered**: If you‚Äôre careless and leave bodies behind, the lockdown will trigger, and reinforcements will arrive.
4. **Escape or Fight**: Once in lockdown, your objective changes to either escaping or surviving until you can disable the lockdown.
